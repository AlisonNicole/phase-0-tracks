## Plan for tackling jQuery 

###1. Research when jQuery comes in most handy
This will help me figure out what I want to do be able to do for the project.

###2. Research jQuery syntax and how it relates to what I've done in JavaScript so far

###3. Find jQuery cheetsheets 
Focus on finding at least 2 different resources that are well organized and easy to read/search


###4. If possible, find and practice with at least 2 different practice assignments before starting my project.
