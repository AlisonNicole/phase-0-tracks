## Plan for tackling jQuery 

###1. Research when jQuery comes in most handy
This will help me figure out what I want to do be able to do for the project.

###2. Research jQuery syntax and how it relates to what I've done in JavaScript so far

###3. Find jQuery cheetsheets 
Focus on finding at least 2 different resources that are well organized and easy to read/search


###4. If possible, find and practice with at least 2 different practice assignments before starting my project.

#### After executing my plan I found that I stuck to it in pretty general terms. By starting out my research looking for when to use jQuery and the syntax I was able to form an idea of what I wanted to do with the project. From there, I utilized a couple of different tutorials that I found to be the most helpful because it allowed me to see functioning jQuery and emulate my code after that.
