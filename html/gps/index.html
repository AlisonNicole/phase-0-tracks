<!-- Comment

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	The semantic tags allow you to organize the sections of each page by the type and priority of information. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The browser reads html from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	I learned about adding snippets and how helpful they can be. I think as I start working with this more and finding that redundancies in my work that I may end up creating more snippets. 

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	I would say release 2 was most difficult because it involved researching where each element should be placed within the larger html file. I think my understanding of the positioning of the elements will come with more practice and more research. I specially plan on using the validator to check my work so I can learn from my mistakes.
