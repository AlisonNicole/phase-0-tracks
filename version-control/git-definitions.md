# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a means of editing code in sections without affecting the master code. It's useful because you can keep the original code the same to avoid negatively impacting the code while making changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an offshoot of the master code that you use to make changes.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a way of adding the changes you made on your branch to the master. A good commit message provides a detailed description of the changes you made in that branch.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when the changes in the branch overwrite the master.
