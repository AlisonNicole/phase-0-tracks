#PROJECT IDEA
# a program that creates a database of websites that the user "likes"

# will have:
# 	- a user- the person sending the link 
# 	- the friend- the person receiving/viewing the link

# user adds link/picture to a "check it out" list for the friend to checkout
	# "hey check out this link! #{link from todo list}"
	# add the link to the "Check It Out" database
	# continue adding links until they dont want to add anymore

# the friend can view their "check it out" list 

# the user can view the links that they've sent, along with who they went to

# user can remove a link from the todo list by viewing/checking out 

# user can update how much they like the link on a scale of 1-10


# what will I need: 
# 	tables:
# 		- user table
# 			- contains ID key 
#			- contains username
# 			- contains user email address
# 		- "check it out" table that contains headers for: 
# 			- link 
# 			- who it's from
# 			- their rating of that link
